# DirectoryEncryption
This is my absolute first python script ever so, you are more that welcome to let me know how I can refactor my code

Just a simple program to encrypt/decrypt all files in given directories.

You can Password Protect you encrypted files

You can now manually add directories

You are free to copy and re use my code as you please.
